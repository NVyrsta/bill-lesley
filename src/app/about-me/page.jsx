            Iâ€™ve been fascinated by math from a young age. The ability to work
            with numbers is one of the most useful and essential skills one can
            develop in school and college. I also believe that mathematical
            sciences can be fun and exciting to learn if you teach them the
            right way. I always strive to improve my skills and develop
            innovative and more effective teaching strategies.

            I am an outgoing Middle School Math Teacher dedicated to building an
            atmosphere that will encourage efficient learning of primary math
            concepts. Working closely with students, I can easily determine all
            their strengths and weaknesses needed to create personalized lesson
            plans. I focus on the development and implementation of flexible
            programs that meet curriculum standards.

            Being a math teacher for more than 10 years I take great
            responsibility for developing and supporting learning programs for
            faculty, teachers, staff, and students. I also have extensive
            experience in the classroom and working in mixed student and
            academic affairs. My research interests include issues related to
            first-year students, high achievers, and educational institutions.
